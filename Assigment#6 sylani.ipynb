    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.\n",
    "One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "•\tattributes\n",
    "•\tbehavior\n",
    "Let's take an example:\n",
    "Parrot is an object,\n",
    "•\tname, age, color are attributes\n",

    "Like parachute pants and Pac-Man, OOP (object-oriented programming) got its start in the 1980s. But unlike trendy fashions \n",
    "and video game characters, this programming model is still going strong after these many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP has become a fundamental part of software development. Thanks to the ubiquity of languages likeJava and C++, you can’t develop software for mobile unless you understand the object-oriented approach. The same goes for serious web development, given the popularity of OOP languages like Python, PHP and Ruby.\n",
    "Getting your head around the idea of object-oriented programming can be challenging for some IT professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why you even need objects when you could use the top-down approach of traditional structured\n",
    "programming in languages like Visual Basic.If you’ve written this kind of software, you’re probably used to breaking down large problems into sub-problems \n",
    "and solving them in separate units of code. Or you may have experience with functional programming, which treats elements of code as precise mathematical functions, and prevents them from affecting other elements, i.e., no side effects.\n",
    "Get to grips with OOP, however, and you’ll see that it’s a whole new way of solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept is that instead of writing a program, you create a class, which is a kind of template containing variables and functions. Objects are self-contained instances of that class, and you can get them to interact in fun and exciting ways.\n",
    "The advantages of object-oriented programming lie in this kind of encapsulation. Here’s a detailed look at some of OOP’s top benefits:\n",
